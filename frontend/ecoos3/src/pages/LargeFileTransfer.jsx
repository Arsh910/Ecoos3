        <h1>How to transfer large files</h1>
        <p className="section__lead">
          Past a few gigabytes, email attachments stop working and every other option trades something
          away: time, money, convenience or setup. Here’s how the realistic choices compare, and how to
          pick one.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cloud">Cloud storage and upload links</h2>
        <p>
          Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive or a file-sending link site: you upload the file,
          and the recipient downloads it whenever they like.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Good for:</strong> sending to someone who isn’t online right now, or to many people with one link.</li>
          <li><strong>The catch:</strong> the file crosses the internet twice — your upload, then their download. Free plans cap file size or total storage, share links on sending services often expire, and the provider keeps a copy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="drive">A physical drive</h2>
        <p>Copy the files to an external drive or SSD and hand it over or ship it.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Good for:</strong> hundreds of gigabytes or more, especially over slow internet. Copying locally is fast and needs no connection at all.</li>
          <li><strong>The catch:</strong> you need to meet in person or post it, you pay for the drive, and it can be lost in transit — encrypt it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="ftp">FTP, SFTP or a self-hosted server</h2>
        <p>Run a server — a classic FTP or SFTP server, or a self-hosted storage app — and share access to it.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Good for:</strong> teams that transfer large files regularly and want full control, with no third-party limits.</li>
          <li><strong>The catch:</strong> someone has to set it up and keep it secure and updated, it needs a machine that stays online, and reaching it from outside usually means router and firewall configuration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="p2p">Direct peer-to-peer transfer</h2>
        <p>
          Tools like <Link to="/">ecoos3</Link> connect the two computers directly, so the file goes from
          one disk to the other without being stored anywhere in between.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Good for:</strong> very large files between two people who can be online together. There’s no upload step and no size cap, and on the same network it’s as fast as the network.</li>
          <li><strong>The catch:</strong> both people must be online at the same time, speed is limited by the sender’s upload, and some strict networks block direct connections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="compare">Side by side</h2>
        <div className="table-wrap">

              ))}

        </div>

        <h2 id="time">How long will it take?</h2>
        <p>
          Over the internet, the limit is almost always the sender’s upload speed, which is often much
          lower than the download speed your provider advertises. Rough transfer times:

          Calculated as gigabytes × 8,000 ÷ Mbps. Real transfers run a little slower because of
          protocol overhead and other traffic on the connection.
        </p>

        <h2 id="reconnect">Recovering from a dropped connection mid-transfer</h2>
        <p>
          A transfer like the ones above can run for hours. Once it’s underway, the two devices send
          data directly to each other and no longer need the signaling connection that helped them find
          each other, so that connection closes. If the direct connection between the devices then
          fails — a Wi-Fi switch, a sleeping laptop, a dropped network — each device reopens a
          connection to the signaling server on its own and rejoins using the same room code. If that
          room had since been cleaned up, it’s recreated, so the code still works.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two devices reconnect to each other and the transfer continues from where it stopped. The
          receiver already knows which chunks it has, so only the missing ones are sent again — an
          interruption at 80% resumes at 80%. A cloud upload that fails partway usually means starting
          over; here, the progress made on both ends is kept.
        </p>
        <p>
          This reconnection is automatic, but it isn’t instant or unconditional: both devices still need
          to be online at the same time for the transfer to progress, the browser can take a minute or
          so to decide a connection is dead before it tries again, and if a device is closed entirely,
          the transfer waits until it’s reopened and resumed by hand.
        </p>

        <h2 id="right">When ecoos3 is a good choice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The file is bigger than your cloud plan allows, and you don’t want to pay for more storage just to send it once.</li>
          <li>You and the recipient can be online together — even in short sessions, because transfers resume where they stopped.</li>
          <li>You’d rather no third party keeps a copy.</li>
          <li>You’re on the same network, where a direct transfer runs at full local speed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="wrong">When ecoos3 is the wrong choice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The recipient can’t be online when you are.</strong> ecoos3 has nowhere to leave a file. Use cloud storage or a sending link.</li>
          <li><strong>You’re sending one file to many people.</strong> A room holds four people, and each recipient gets their own stream from your upload. A shared link scales much better.</li>
          <li><strong>The recipient uses Firefox or Safari.</strong> Receiving needs a Chromium browser, so they’d need Chrome, Edge, Brave or Arc.</li>
          <li><strong>Either of you is on a network that blocks direct connections</strong>, such as a strict corporate firewall. Until relay support arrives, use cloud storage or a drive.</li>
          <li><strong>Terabytes over a slow connection.</strong> 1 TB over a 50 Mbps upload is about 44 hours of transfer time. Resume lets you spread that over several days, but posting a drive may still be quicker.</li>
        </ul>
