## What is ecoos3?

ecoos3 is a peer-to-peer transfer app that runs entirely in your browser. Open it, create a
room, share the six-character code, and anyone who joins can exchange messages and files
with you directly.

The files never touch a server. They move over an encrypted connection straight from one
browser to the other, which means there's no upload wait, no storage quota, and no copy of
your data sitting in somebody else's datacentre. A 30 GB video moves the same way a 30 KB
text file does.

It's built for the moment you need to hand a large file to someone **right now** — a
colleague across the desk, your own laptop across the room, a friend across the world —
without email limits, cloud accounts, or a USB stick.

## Features

- 📡 **Direct transfers** — files stream browser-to-browser, never through a server
- ♾️ **No size limit** — files are written straight to disk as they arrive, not held in memory
- ⏯️ **Resume anytime** — an interrupted transfer picks up where it stopped, even days later
- 🔁 **Reconnects itself** — a dropped connection is retried in the background, with a banner
  telling you whether it's still trying or has given up
- 🚪 **Leave and come back** — leave a room and keep your progress, or discard it
- 👥 **Up to 4 people per room** — everyone connects to everyone, not through a host
- 🎯 **Pick your recipients** — send to the whole room, or select just the people you want
- ✋ **Accept before you receive** — nothing lands on your disk until you choose where to save it
- 🏷️ **Name yourself** — set an alias so people see `Arsh-af46` instead of `af46c1d2`; change
  it anytime, you're still recognised as the same person
- 💬 **Live messaging** — a chat alongside the transfers, over the same connection
- 🔒 **Encrypted by default** — every connection is DTLS-encrypted end to end
- 🌑 **Clean dark interface** — one screen, no menus, nothing to configure

## How it works

**1. Create a room** — you get a six-character code like `K7M2QX`. Ambiguous characters
(`I`, `O`, `0`, `1`) are left out, so it's safe to read aloud over a call.

**2. Share the code** — up to three other people enter it and join. Everyone appears in the
peer list as they connect.

**3. Send** — drop a file or type a message. By default it goes to everyone in the room;
click peers in the list to narrow it down.

**4. Receive** — an incoming file waits for you to press **Accept**, then asks where to save
it. It streams to that location as it arrives, and completed media files get an **Open**
button.

Rooms are temporary. When the last person leaves, the room disappears.

## Resuming transfers

Big transfers get interrupted — a laptop sleeps, a tab closes, Wi-Fi drops. ecoos3 remembers
how far each one got, so you only ever send the part that's missing.

**Example: a 40 GB video library over a long weekend**

1. **Friday evening** — you start sending the library to a friend. At 60%, your laptop's
   battery dies.
2. **Monday morning** — you both open ecoos3 again. The transfer is waiting at the top under
   **Unfinished transfers**, marked **Waiting for peer**.
3. **Reconnect** — create a room (a brand-new code is fine) and your friend joins. As soon as
   you're both in, ecoos3 recognises the transfer on both sides and **Resume** unlocks.
4. **Resume** — click it on both ends. The browser asks permission to reopen the file (that's
   what **Resume (grant access)** means), and only the missing 40% is sent.

Before continuing, ecoos3 checks it's the exact same file. If it was edited or replaced in the
meantime, you're told so instead of ending up with a mix of two files.

- Survives reloads, closed tabs, restarts and days away — unfinished transfers are kept for
  30 days
- Works in **any room**, as long as it's the same two people
- **Save progress for resume** is on by default. Progress is only saved when both people have
  it on — if either has it off, ecoos3 warns you before the transfer starts
- **Discard** removes a transfer for good — for received files, the partial file is deleted
  too where the browser allows it
- In Firefox and Safari, the sender picks the same file again to resume (**Select file to
  resume**)

> **Note**
> The sender's percentage under **Unfinished transfers** is the last progress the receiver
> reported, so it can trail the receiver's by a few seconds of transfer. It catches up as soon
> as you reconnect, and resuming always goes by what the receiver actually has.

## When the connection drops

Staying in a room is enough — if the connection to the signalling server drops, ecoos3 retries
on its own, and there's nothing to click. A banner at the top of the page says where things
stand:

- **Reconnecting** — the drop just happened and is being retried. Short blips clear by
  themselves and you'll rarely see more than this
- **Disconnected** — still out of reach after a couple of minutes. Retries carry on, spaced
  further apart. Refreshing the page is safe
- **Failed** — out of reach for six minutes, so retrying stops. Connect using a new room and
  resume from **Unfinished transfers**

Your progress is kept throughout, so a reconnect never costs you what has already transferred.
Remember that files move directly between browsers: once a transfer is running, the signalling
server is only needed again if the two of you have to find each other afresh.

## Browser support

Sending files and messaging work in **every modern browser**. Receiving files needs the
[File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API),
which is currently Chromium-only.

| Browser | Send files | Receive files | Resume | Messaging |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Firefox | ✅ | ❌ | Sending, by re-selecting the file | ✅ |
| Safari | ✅ | ❌ | Sending, by re-selecting the file | ✅ |

> **Note**
> ecoos3 detects this on load. In Firefox or Safari you'll see a banner explaining the
> limitation, and the **Accept** button is disabled — everything else keeps working, so you
> can still send a large file to someone on Chrome.

This is a deliberate trade-off. Writing directly to disk is what removes the size ceiling;
the usual fallback buffers the whole file in memory first, which caps transfers at a couple
of gigabytes and risks crashing the tab.

**Also required:** WebRTC data channels, available in all of the above.

## Privacy

- Files and messages travel **directly between browsers**, encrypted with DTLS
- The server only helps two browsers find each other — it never sees file contents
- Nothing is stored on a server. To make resuming possible, your browser keeps a note of
  unfinished transfers (file name, size, progress) — only on your device, cleared after 30
  days or when you discard them
- No accounts, no sign-in, no tracking

Peers on restrictive networks may not be able to reach each other directly, since ecoos3 uses
a public STUN server and no relay fallback.

## Running it locally

The hosted app is at [ecoos3.duckdns.org](https://ecoos3.duckdns.org) if you'd rather not run
your own. To build it yourself you'll need [Go](https://go.dev/) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
# signalling server — http://localhost:8080
cd server
go run ./api

# web app — http://localhost:5173
cd frontend/ecoos3
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the app in two browser windows, create a room in one, and join with the code in the
other.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PORT` | `8080` | Port for the signalling server |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:5173`, `http://127.0.0.1:5173` | Comma-separated origins allowed to reach the API |

## Limits

- **4 people per room** — beyond that, the number of direct connections each browser has to
  maintain starts to hurt
- **One file at a time** per sender
- **Rooms are not persistent** — codes are not reusable once everyone leaves (transfers still
  resume in a new room)
- **Resume needs the same browser** on both ends — clearing site data or switching browsers
  starts fresh
- **No relay fallback** — a symmetric NAT or strict corporate firewall on both ends can
  block the direct connection
